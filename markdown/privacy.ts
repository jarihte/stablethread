6.5 User Obligations when Accessing other User Information. In connection with using our
Services, you may receive and determine what to do with certain personal information from your users, such as
when communicating with them and entering into transactions with them. This means you process personal
information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and, to the extent you do so, under EU
law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may have obtained through the
Services. You are responsible for protecting user personal information you receive or process and complying with all
relevant legal requirements when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws
that govern the ways in which you can use a user’s information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply
with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to your users and compatible with this policy and
Company’s Terms of Use. For more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more resources at
https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie. As a data controller, to the extent that you process users’ personal
information outside of the Services, you may be required under applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor
requests for data access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to processing. Also, if you disclose personal
information without the user’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. This includes,
for example, disclosures you intentionally make or unintentional data breaches. For example, you may receive a
buyer’s email address or other information as a result of entering into a transaction with that buyer. This information
may only be used for the authorized purpose. You may not use this information for unsolicited commercial messages
or unauthorized transactions. Without the user’s consent, and subject to other applicable Company policies and laws,
you may not add any user to your email or physical mailing list, use that user’s identity for marketing, or obtain or
retain any payment information. Please bear in mind that you’re responsible for knowing the standard of consent
required in any given instance. If Company and you are found to be joint data controllers of personal information,
and if Company is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data
controller of users’ personal information, you agree to indemnify Company for the expenses it occurs in connection
with your processing of users’ personal information.
