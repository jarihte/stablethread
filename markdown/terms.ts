8.2 Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek
arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature
and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to the Company
address set forth above. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the
Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if
any, to which either party is entitled.

8.3 Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set
forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR
Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The
AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at
www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.
Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the
party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing
will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable
notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the
greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements
arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

8.4 Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the
specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

8.5 Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated
and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

8.6 Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on
an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
you and the Company.

8.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead
electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. Arbitration
procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject
to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state
or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

8.8 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE
SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL
BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER
CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

8.9 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award
of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court
of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
equitable relief.

8.10 Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Clause are found under the law to be invalid
or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect
and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

8.11 Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Clause may be
waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of
this Arbitration Agreement.

8.12 Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Clause will survive the termination of your relationship
with Company.

8.13 Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an
individual action in small claims court.

8.14 Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency
equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for
interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Clause.

8.15 Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation,
violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent,
copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Clause.

8.16 Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Clause permits the parties to
litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Delaware, for such purpose
